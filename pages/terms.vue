      <div class="ml-4">(a) Polaris reasonably suspects that the Customer is intentionally using the Service in
        contravention of any applicable law, and fails to cease such action within seven (7) days of being notified by

        Polaris;
      </div>
      <div class="ml-4">(c) the Customer does or allows anything to be done which in Polaris's reasonable opinion may
        jeopardise the operation of the Service or the Polaris’ network; or
      </div>

        Payment Date.
      </div>
      <div>9.2 Upon any such suspension pursuant to any of the grounds specified, the Customer shall be liable for all
        charges and fees incurred up to and including the date of such suspension.
      </div>
      <div>9.3 If, within 14 days of a suspension, the Customer rectifies all of the grounds for which such suspension
        has been effected (if such grounds may be rectified), then the Customer may request Polaris to reconnect the
        Service. Upon such request, Polaris may reconnect the Service and shall reserve the right to impose on the
        Customer a reconnection fee and such other fees as it deems appropriate.
